# quick deploy
is a repo used by me so I can quickly set a server / personal computer up and running with my own settings.

# how to use
on debian based OSs : 
`sudo apt update && sudo apt install git`

clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/someboringnerd/quick-deploy`

run the installator

`cd quick-deploy && sudo ./install && ./ohmyz.sh && ./apply-zsh-config.sh`

reboot and profit.

# TODO
-> add mysql installator
-> add mysql templates
-> auto clone my projects if needed
-> install Unity, VSCode, dependancies, etc...
