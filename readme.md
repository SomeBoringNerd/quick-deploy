# quick deploy
Is a repo used by me so I can quickly set a server / personal computer up and running with my own settings.

you likely dont need it.

if on a server, you need to be on Ubuntu Server (as it is what I currently use)

if on a computer you need to be on Arch Linux (or a Arch based distro)

clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/someboringnerd/quick-deploy`

run the installator

`cd quick-deploy && sudo ./install`

reboot and profit.
